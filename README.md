This repo consists on a solution to an interesting real life problem, looking for an accurate and efficient algorithm that relies on the mathematics from the fundamental fields of calculus and probability.

# Problem description: 
You are given a unique investment opportunity.
Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f, of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.
Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.
For example, if f = 1/4, for the first toss you bet £0.25, and if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet £0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.
Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?

# Solution :
In order to allow others to enjoy the experience of solving the problem by themselves, one can only see the quantitative answer with 12 digits of precision printed on screen when executing the main program. On the other hand, I decided to visualize the results obtained after coming up with the solution by graphing a function that I derived, which tells you the minimum number of heads needed (yes, even though it feels counterintuitive it turns
out that order doesnt matter if that makes any sense🫢). I also plotted a function relating proportions and respective minimum number of heads for making more than a billion as well as a 3d plot relating proportion, heads seen and resulting capital after 1000 tosses.
